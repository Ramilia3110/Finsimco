          <h4>PRACTICAL</h4>
          <p>
            The simulations are the results of R&D in which various corporate
            finance, leveraged finance and risk professionals contributed. From
            finance foundations to complex corporate valuations, the realistic
            practical application is in every stage.

        <div class="box box2">
          <h4>ENGAGING</h4>
          <p>
            The simulations involve competition between teams and risk-taking
            elements to excite people. The energy throughout the process is
            intense given the competitive elements while analysing, discussing,
            pitching and negotiating financial instruments and companies.

          <h4>INNOVATIVE</h4>
          <p>
            We offer a highly innovative training concept immersing participants
            in various investment banking tasks and leveraging stochastic
            modelling techniques to gamify the learning at the right pace.
          </p>

        <div class="box box4">
          <h4>PARTICIPANTS ARE LOVING IT</h4>
          <p>
            Teams run their simulated investment bank and watch their own P&L
            rise and fall. They compete against each other in their own market,
            not against a computer. The gamification of learning technical
            corporate finance skills leads to very high participant
            satisfaction.

          </h4>
          <p>
            We support clients beyond a particular training event. Our products
            are tailored towards clientsâ€™ needs and follow up consultations as
            well as testing options are available.

            VALUE FOR
            <br />MONEY
          </h4>
          <p>
            Our products are cost-effective because participants learn practical
            skills in a short time-frame, and they can directly apply what they
            have learned. Participants returning to their desk have a better
            understanding of their tasks and have gained a big picture
            understanding of different departments.
